Your holding of [Ace of Spade and Ten of Diamond] is a moderately strong starting hand. However, the current board [King of Spade, Seven of Heart, Two of Diamond, Jack of Club] has minimal help. The pair of Jacks on the turn reinforces the board, making your pair of Aces and Tens slightly less likely to win if the SB has a stronger holding. Since the SB has already bet and let you continue with a check, you are at -2 chips. Considering the SB's bet and your position, you should probably fold here to avoid losing more chips. \n",
